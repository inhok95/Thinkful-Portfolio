          <div>
            <p>I graduated from Univeristy of Maryland in 2018 with a bachelors in general biology. After graduating, I took a short break from studying, trying various things such as travelling, working part-time, reading, and studying other subjects.</p>

            <!-- Add a link using the word "Thinkful" to it's homepage-->
            <p>In the midst of my break, I dabbled in programming. The qualities of coding that drew me in were: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating and designing</li>
              <li>Solving problems</li>
              <li>Working with other people</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By enrolling in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/"> Thinkful</a>, I hope to explore web developing and find a career. If not, we can always talk about video games, music, movies, and TV shows.</p>
